## FileSync üöÄ
FileSync is a file synchronization and management tool that uses both TCP and UDP communication 
protocols to handle file transfers and synchronization between a client and a server. 
It ensures that files are efficiently and securely synchronized, keeping them up-to-date between
devices or systems.

## Features ‚ú®
- TCP Server: Handles file synchronization tasks and manages connections with multiple clients.
- UDP Discovery: Uses multicast to allow clients to discover the server and establish communication.
- File Comparison: Compares file modification dates to determine if a file needs to be transferred or updated.
- File Storage: Saves client files in an organized directory structure, with support for handling large amounts of data.
- Synchronization Rate: Allows users to set a synchronization rate for file updates and transfers.

## Custom Protocols üîß
In FileSync, communication between the client and server is managed using custom protocols designed to handle file synchronization tasks efficiently. These protocols are built on top of standard networking protocols (TCP/UDP) and are structured in a way that allows for smooth communication during file transfers, discovery, and synchronization.

### Overview of Protocols üìù
The project uses JSON-based protocols that define the structure of the messages exchanged between the server and the client. The communication is split into different types of messages, each serving a specific purpose in the synchronization process.

### Protocol Types üìù
Here are the primary protocol types used in FileSync:

1. **DISCOVER**
   - Sent by the client to discover available server.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "DISCOVER"
     }
     ```

2. **OFFER**
   - Sent by the server in response to a DISCOVER message, offering a connection (including the TCP port number).
     ```json
     {
       "type": "OFFER",
       "port": 12345
     }
     ```

3. **BUSY**
   - Sent by the server when it is unavailable.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "BUSY"
     }
     ```

4. **READY**
   - Sent by the server to indicate it is ready for file exchange.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "READY"
     }
     ```

5. **ARCHIVE_INFO**
   - Sent by the client to provide details about the files to be archived or synchronized.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "ARCHIVE_INFO",
       "client_id": "id",
       "files": [
         {
           "filename": "file.txt",
           "file_path": "documents/file.txt"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

6. **ARCHIVE_TASKS**
   - Sent by the server to specify which files need to be archived.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "ARCHIVE_TASKS",
       "files": [
         {
           "filename": "file.txt",
           "file_path": "documents/file.txt"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

7. **ARCHIVE_DATA**
   - Sent by the client with base64-encoded file data and associated metadata (e.g., modification timestamp).
     ```json
     {
       "type": "ARCHIVE_DATA",
       "client_id": "id",
       "files_data": [
         {
           "filename": "file.txt",
           "file_path": "documents/file.txt",
           "last_modified": "2025-04-29T14:00:00",
           "content": "base64-encoded-data"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

8. **NEXT_SYNC**
   - Sent by the server to indicate the time for the next synchronization.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "NEXT_SYNC",
       "next_sync_time": "2025-05-01T12:00:00"
     }
     ```

9. **NOT_PROTOCOL_INFO**
   - Indicates that the received message does not conform to any known protocol.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "NOT_PROTOCOL_INFO"
     }
     ```
     
### Protocol Handling ‚öôÔ∏è

The custom protocols are handled through the `protocols.py` file. Each protocol type has a corresponding function that generates a JSON-encoded message. Functions are available for encoding and decoding messages, including file data and metadata.
